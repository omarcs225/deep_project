# Multi-Class Segmentation from a Single-Class Conditional 3D UNet in TensorFlow
##This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of a 3D UNet model with dense blocks and class-conditional segmentation, allowing a single model to perform segmentation for multiple classes by conditioning on class-specific input.
